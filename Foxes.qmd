# Catching Foxes

Pre-engagement counseling - start working on critical issues now, and plan to resolve them prior to engagement

History (of yourself and spouse) provides context:

Gives you perspective

Allows you to understand each others' vulnerabilities

## Chapter 1 - Personal History

Gospel is the power of God for salvation Rom 1:16

Scripture allows us to :

-   Interpret our history truthfully

-   Respond to our history triumphantly

-   Behold the glory of Christ shining through

God uses our experiences for our good

-   Experiences do not control us

-   God controls our life and destiny

> II Cor 5:14 For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died;

History does not determine who you are, but has influenced the way you think, feel, and live and have impacted your view of the world.

Now is the time to honestly discuss secrets from your past - now is the time to be honest

## Chapter 4

Do you carry a zeal for the eternal purposes of God?

Purpose of Marnage

Marrage doesn't belong to the couple

No helper suitable for him

For this reason: Leave + cleave

Created to know, enjoy, worship God

Not good to be alone - God was part of a family

Adam had one to love/serve

AND There was no helper suitable for him

Everything created exists to glorfy God

Alone, Adam couldn't display the image of God

Marnage is a gift from God (to be stewarded)

Marriage is a covenant which pictures, embodies,

and points to the eternal covenant between

Christ and the church.

Manage exists as a means of multiplying

Marrage exists to exhort the next generation

But spirtual multiplication is primary -\>

Covenant

Go and make disciples

Submission to Christ overrules submission to husband

.. As is fitting in the Lord = fitting to a Christian Woman

I Pet 3

Precious in the sight of the Lord

Chaste respectful gentle quiet

Ly refuse to use beauty to bring glory

and attention to yourself.

## Chapter 8 - Conflict

Source of all conflict

> James 4:1-4: What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? ^**2**^ You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. ^**3**^ You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.^**4**^ You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.

cf Unforgiving servant

Need hearts that love God

Ask yourself: What does my heart love so strongly that I am willing to fight for it?

Eager for forgiveness:

-   w/o repentance, we can cover a transgression

-   w/repentance-\> cancel and bring restoration
