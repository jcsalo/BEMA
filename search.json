Actual valley outside Jerusalem. Also known as Topheth\n\n7:30 “For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, declares the Lord. They have set their detestable things in the house that is called by my name, to defile it. 31 And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind. 32 Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when it will no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth, because there is no room elsewhere. 33 And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, and none will frighten them away. 34 And I will silence in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste.\n8 “At that time, declares the Lord, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be brought out of their tombs. 2 And they shall be spread before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have gone after, and which they have sought and worshiped. And they shall not be gathered or buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. 3 Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family in all the places where I have driven them, declares the Lord of hosts.\n19 Thus says the Lord, “Go, buy a potter’s earthenware flask, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the elders of the priests, 2 and go out to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you. 3 You shall say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such disaster upon this place that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle. 4 Because the people have forsaken me and have profaned this place by making offerings in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known; and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents, 5 and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my mind— 6 therefore, behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when this place shall no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.7 And in this place I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, and will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth. 8 And I will make this city a horror, a thing to be hissed at. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its wounds. 9 And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and everyone shall eat the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them.’\n\n\n\n3.10.2 70 Years of Babylonian Captivity\n\n25 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), 2 which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 3 “For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the Lord has come to me, and I have spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened. 4 You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the Lord persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets, 5 saying, ‘Turn now, every one of you, from his evil way and evil deeds, and dwell upon the land that the Lord has given to you and your fathers from of old and forever. 6 Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’ 7 Yet you have not listened to me, declares the Lord, that you might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.\n\n\n8 “Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words, 9 behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, declares the Lord, and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I will devote them to destruction, and make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation. 10 Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones and the light of the lamp. 11 This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 12 Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the Lord, making the land an everlasting waste. 13 I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. 14 For many nations and great kings shall make slaves even of them, and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”\n\nJeremiah predicts the 70 years of Babylonian captivity, and draws the connection that Judah persisted in idolatry\nChronicles 36:20 comments on that prophecy\n\n20 He took into exile in Babylon those who had escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and to his sons until the establishment of the kingdom of Persia, 21 to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days that it lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.\n\nChronicles draws the connection that the Babylonian captivity was related to failure to keep the Sabbath (and the other OT economic policies, including Shemitah and Jubilee)",

    "section": "",
    "text": "8.0.1 Chapter 1:\n\nI start by having each person share their personal testimony.\nHow would you describe your present relationship with the Lord (spiritual disciplines, intimacy etc.)?\nWhat would be one area of spiritual growth that you believe you need help in?\nTell me the story of you two meeting, courting, engagement.\nWhat did you learn about marriage from your family of origin that you’d like to emulate?\nWhat would you like to do differently?\nCommitment to purity (victories, struggles)?\nHave you talked about past sexual sin, abuse, involvement?\n\nAnswers given generally set the pace for where the conversation goes next.\n\n\n8.0.2 Chapter 2:\nPage 47 - Question #4 “What do you think it means to seek Christ and his Kingdom in your marriage?\n\n\n8.0.3 Chapter 3:\nWhat kind of rhythms do you have set in your lives for regular accountability - encouragement in a life of repentance and obedience?\nPage 58 - Question #7 “What do you tend to run after for comfort, refuge, or deliverance? Do you run to sports, food, career, isolation, or something else?”\n\n\n8.0.4 Chapter 4:\nPage 73 - Questions #1-2 Explain what “Let no man separate” means to you\nWhat difficulties do you foresee in leaving your original family in order to be joined to your husband or wife? Share ways in which you could be too attached to or dependent upon your father, mother, or siblings - whether this involves their approval, respect, money, or advice\nPage 77 - Questions #5-6 Share your desires for having children or not having children Share your fears about having children\n\n\n8.0.5 Chapter 5:\nI usually start this meeting with a talk on the practice of identifying evidences of grace in one another. The practice of being on the lookout for places where you see the Spirit of God doing good work in one another and making that a regular practice/culture in marriage. I then ask them to practice - tell me one place you see in your fiancé that the Lord is clearly at work - actually - talk to each other. Then I ask them to identify one evidence of grace in their relationship.\nHow is a covenantal view of marriage different from a contractual view of marriage (or pg 84, Q1)?\nSide-Note: I think this to be one of the most important lines in the entire book. “Christian marriage should be distinguished from other kinds of marriage not by the absence of sin but by the presence of redeeming and reconciling grace” (pg 95).\nExplain your perspective on divorce. Is it an option as you go into marriage? Usually looking for solid understanding of covenant and generally want to hear from a couple that divorce is a last resort.\n\n\n8.0.6 Chapter 6:\n\nPg 105 - Question #2 If there are things that he wants to talk about - I will engage. But for the most part I spend this time talking about what it means to be a biblical man / husband. God given responsibility to lead, serve, and protect. What is your view of biblical headship & submission?\n\n\n\n8.0.7 Chapter 7:\n\nWhat is your view of biblical headship & submission?\nPg 130 - Q4\nPg 131 - Q5\nPg 137 - Q8\n\n\n\n8.0.8 Chapters 8-9:\nI probably lean less heavily on book questions for these chapters. I’m generally after a cohesive understanding of how each saw conflict handled in their family of origin and how they’ve tended to handle conflict as a couple thus far. This almost always becomes a conversation about communication. When conflict enters - is your fiancé the one you are in conflict with or are you two united to deal with the conflict? What does it look like to be “on the same team” against a particular conflict? Put into the practice - regularly asking one another - “If you knew I wouldn’t get defensive or angry - what is one thing you think I could do to be a better husband / wife to you?”\n\n\n8.0.9 Chapter 10:\nHow did your conversation about this chapter prior to our meeting go? Are there specific ways I can serve you two as y’all prepare for sexual intimacy?\n\n\n8.0.10 Chapter 11:\nWho is the spender? Who is the saver? What does it look like for you two to prioritize kingdom values in your financial stewardship as a married couple? What is your current work/life balance? Areas of struggle or opportunities for growth? Do you need help with budgeting or other financial preparations?\n\n\n8.0.11 Chapter 12:\nNo specific questions I lean on here. This usually winds up being more of a discussion of expectations based on the accumulated information I have from meeting with the couple over time.",
