Letter written before Jerusalem Council - likely his first letter (directly after Acts)

Hillel argued that Theosabes were kept on the fringe (unless they convert = circumcision)

Herod had an arrangement with Caesar ("Jewish Exception"). Jews would offer worship "for Caesar" rather than worship "to Caesar." Theosabes found it easier to convert to Judiasm to avoid threat from Romans of refusing to worship Caesar.

What to do with the Theosabes (God-fearing Gentiles)?

Gospel - Paul states that gospel is a gospel of inclusion

\[Gospel = pronouncement of a new king and a new kindgom\]
